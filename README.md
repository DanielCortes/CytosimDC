# CytosimDC
Modified Cytosim with functions for different bond types including PCM, Catch bond, and Catch-Slip bond. 

This version has been optimized to work on CYGWIN running within Windows 10. BlitBUFF functions for offscreen rendering have been largely disabled due to an incompatibility with Windows DirectX 11. This results in a partial incompatibility with MacOS.
